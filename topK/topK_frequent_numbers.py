Problem Statement 
Given an unsorted array of numbers, find the top â€˜Kâ€™ frequently occurring numbers in it.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 3, 5, 12, 11, 12, 11], K = 2
Output: [12, 11]
Explanation: Both '11' and '12' apeared twice.
Example 2:

Input: [5, 12, 11, 3, 11], K = 2
Output: [11, 5] or [11, 12] or [11, 3]
Explanation: Only '11' appeared twice, all other numbers appeared once.
